Russian balloon record tilt held up by Perth customs 'delay'
 


A Russian hot air balloon support crew says it could miss a vital window to break a world record because equipment has yet to clear customs in Perth.

Russian adventurer Fedor Konyukhov wants to fly a 52-metre high helium balloon solo and non-stop around the globe, starting in Northam, 100 kilometres north-east of Perth.

The 63-year-old Russian orthodox priest hopes to become the second person behind American Steve Fossett to solo circumnavigate the world in 13 days.

But the record attempt could be thwarted before it begins, because of an apparent hold up getting equipment shipped to Perth.

The adventurer's son, Oscar, said 35 stainless steel cylinders and the balloon's fabric envelop were shipped from the United Kingdom and arrived in Perth late last month.

He said the items still had not been cleared and the brief window of suitable weather was fast disappearing.
